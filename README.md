# Trading Analysis and Stock Price Prediction using PySpark

## 1. Introduction 
In an increasingly data-driven world, PySpark is a critical tool for big data analytics. This project explores PySpark's immense potential in trading (data) analysis and stock price prediction using Machine Learning techniques. A comprehensive exploratory analysis of our stock dataset is performed, where key metrics such as profitability and consistent growth of stocks is visually explored. Furthermore, technical indicators such as Moving Averages and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are incorporated to provide deeper insights into trends of the stock market and stock prices. Subsequently, data preprocessing is performed which comprises cleaning of the dataset and engineering a crucial feature, Normalized Close which serves as the target variable for predictive modeling. PySpark’s machine learning library (MLlib) is utilized for the ML needs of this project. A Random Forest Regression model is trained to predict normalized closing prices for stocks in this project’s effort to implement a robust and efficient system for analyzing large-scale stock data. Finally,  a backtesting simulation strategy is implemented which utilizes historical stock data to simulate trading decisions, offering insights into the model's real-world applicability and profitability.
